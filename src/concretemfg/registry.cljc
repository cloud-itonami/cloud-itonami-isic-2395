  "Pure-function domain logic for the concrete/cement/plaster products
  plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification,
  shipment-weight recompute, product-type validation, dimensional-
  deviation plausibility validation, defect-rate plausibility
  validation, and draft maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination
  record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/concretemfg`-style capability library to
  wrap (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore
  lives here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `concretemfg.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `claymfg.registry/shipment-weight-exceeded?` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2392`, the closest architectural sibling): never
  trust a proposal's own self-reported weight/status when the inputs
  needed to recompute it independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance window, a
  coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating a mixing/batching
  plant or molding line, or dispatching a real freight carrier (this
  actor NEVER does either -- see README `What this actor does NOT
  do`).

  SCOPE NOTE: ISIC 2395 (this actor) covers ARTICLES OF CONCRETE,
  CEMENT AND PLASTER -- mixing/batching of concrete or cement or
  plaster slurry -> molding/casting into forms (precast panels, pipes,
  blocks, paving slabs, roof tiles, posts) -> curing (steam curing,
  autoclave curing, or ambient curing) production lines. This is a
  distinct plant, with a distinct hazard profile (cement/silica-dust
  hazard at batching and mold-stripping, curing-heat/steam-burn hazard
  at the curing chamber or autoclave, mixer/batching-plant pinch-point
  hazard, heavy precast-unit handling/crane hazard), from a clay
  building materials plant (`cloud-itonami-isic-2392`, which fires
  extruded clay in a kiln) or a cut-stone plant
  (`cloud-itonami-isic-2396`) -- the central physical hazard here is
  cement/silica-dust exposure at mixing and curing-heat exposure at the
  curing chamber, not kiln-firing or stone-cutting.")
